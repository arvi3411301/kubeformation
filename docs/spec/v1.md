# Cluster Spec v1

Reference documentation for the structure of the config file
which contains the specifications for a Kubernetes cluster. The specification
remains same for all providers, but possible values for certain keys change
depending on the provider (e.g. k8s versions available differs on GKE & AKS).

Complete documentation can be found at [`v1/ClusterSpec`](https://godoc.org/github.com/hasura/kubeformation/pkg/spec/v1/#ClusterSpec).
